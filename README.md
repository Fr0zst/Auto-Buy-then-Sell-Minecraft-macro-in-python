# Auto-Buy-then-Sell-Minecraft-macro-in-python


First install python which i will provide a link to it here:https://www.python.org/downloads/

Second go into Windows Search-------->Windows Powershell

Then type "pip install pyautogui" "pip install keyboard" "pip install datetime" "pip install random"

If it says missing module just pip install (module missing)

Then in powershell type cd "C:\Users\"name"\path\to\the\file"
Then after that run it with python MoneyMacro.py

If you have any issues just leave it in the issue thing i should be able to help you!
